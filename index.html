			<p>Beginning Developer. Personally studying in the arenas of Entrepreneurship and Management. Been teaching my self computer programming (JavaScript, Ruby, Python) for the past six months. Actively working on a stealth startup.</p>
			<p>I transferred from Drexel University to Indiana University Northwest in the summer of 2012. Throughout the summer and the subsequent year, I delved deep into the arena of tech entrepreneurship. I became aquainted with the different companies, founders, and top angel investors and Venture Capitalists.</p>
			<p>In that same time, I went deeper into the realms of "self help" than the average man scouring the works of Brian Tracy, Earl Nightingale, and Napoleon Hill - especially Napoleon Hill.</p>
			<p>In November 2012, my now Entrepreneurial mentor Sean Everett encouraged me to begin teaching myself computer programming, which I did. In April 2013, I joined the Starter League in downtown Chicago. 
			</p>
			<p>Currently, I am working on my stealth startup as well as my duties as a student at the Starter League. As a side research project, I have been compiling data on the best products and services both consumers and small businesses can use. This is part of a future endeavor and if you would like to see any of my research, please reach out and let me know.</p>
